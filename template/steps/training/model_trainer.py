    """Configure and train a model on the training dataset.

    This is an example of a model training step that takes in a dataset artifact
    previously loaded and pre-processed by other steps in your pipeline, then
    configures and trains a model on it. The model is then returned as a step
    output artifact.

    Model training steps should have caching disabled if they are not
    deterministic (i.e. if the model training involve some random processes
    like initializing weights or shuffling data that are not controlled by
    setting a fixed random seed). This example step ensures the outcome is
    deterministic by initializing the model with a fixed random seed.

    This step is parameterized to configure the step independently of the step code,
    before running it in a pipeline. In this example, the step can be configured
    to use a different model, change the random seed, or pass different
    hyperparameters to the model constructor. See the documentation for more
    information:

        https://docs.zenml.io/user-guide/advanced-guide/configure-steps-pipelines

    Args:
        dataset_trn: The preprocessed train dataset.
        model_config: `ModelMetadata` to train on
        target: Name of target columns in dataset.
        random_seed: Fixed seed of random generator.

    Returns:
        The trained model artifact.
